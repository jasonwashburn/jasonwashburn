- 👋 Hi, I’m Jason Washburn
- 👀 I’m passionate about starting a second career in software development.
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my skills with Python while brushing up on HTML/CSS/JS so I can give node.js and react a look.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can help me gain experience building/maintaining larger projects. Bonus points if its something related to assitive technology to aid with disabilities!
